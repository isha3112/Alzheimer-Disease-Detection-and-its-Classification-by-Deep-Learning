1.Conducted academic research aiming to classify Alzheimer's disease (AD) stages using Electroencephalography (EEG) signals.
2. Conducted extensive pre-processing on publicly available EEG datasets, including data augmentation techniques  to enhance dataset size and quality.
3. Utilised a deep learning approach, specifically a modified 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to extract meaningful features from EEG signals.
4. Achieved significant results with the proposed model, achieving a high accuracy rate in classifying EEG signals into three categories: normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and moderate dementia, thus providing a promising tool for early detection of AD.
